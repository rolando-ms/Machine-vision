# Machine vision
Repository of the Machine vision lecture + Lab (1535382)
This project detects the edges of a hardcoded name image located in the same directory of the main program (edge_detection.py). The modules used are located in the subfolders. 

The user can try out with any image but it is strongly recommended to run the program with a low res RGB picture due to the fact that the project is not yet optimized.

The project was created and tested with the following programs and library versions:
*Python 2.7.5
*Pillow 2.2.1
*cmake 2.8.11.2
*Matplotlib 1.4.2
*Numpy 1.9.0
(All of them in 32 bits version)

If the histogram plot is requested, it can be seen by uncommenting the last part of the main program.
